# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

- Keep README.md up to date with latest capabilities but avoid unnecessary changes. Only update the README when latest capabilities introduce breakages to the documented README commands.

## Code Changes

- Ensure the code can be compiled
- Ensure the code is formatted
- Any clippy warnings are addressed
- When writing an if/else clause, prefer putting the clause with most of the code in the else part to keep the whole conditional more readable
- Avoid arrowized code when possible

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output
