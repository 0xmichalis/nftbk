# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

- Keep README.md up to date with latest capabilities but avoid unnecessary changes. Only update the README when latest capabilities introduce breakages to the documented README commands.

## Code Changes

- Ensure the code you have provided is complete
- Ensure the project can be compiled
- Ensure the project is formatted
- Ensure that any clippy warnings are addressed
- When writing an if/else clause, prefer putting the clause with most of the code in the else part to keep the whole conditional more readable
- Avoid arrowized code when possible

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output

## Misc

- When providing a solution, give me a score on a scale of 1-10 about how confident you are in the solution
