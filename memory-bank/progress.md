# Progress: nftbk

## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with core features implemented and working. It can successfully back up NFTs from Ethereum-based chains and Tezos, handling various content types and storage methods.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Command-line interface with configurable options
- ✅ TOML configuration file parsing
- ✅ Ethereum-based chain support (Ethereum, Zora, Base, Arbitrum)
- ✅ Tezos blockchain support
- ✅ Metadata retrieval and storage
- ✅ Content downloading and organization

### Content Handling
- ✅ Image files (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP)
- ✅ Video files (MP4, MOV, MPG)
- ✅ 3D models (GLB)
- ✅ HTML content with embedded resources
- ✅ Data URL decoding
- ✅ IPFS URL resolution
- ✅ Media type detection from binary content

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful error recovery
- ✅ Detailed logging
- ✅ Retry mechanism for rate-limited API calls

### Configuration
- ✅ Custom output path support
- ✅ Configurable logging levels
- ✅ Gallery.so integration for token extraction

## What's Left to Build

### Performance Improvements
- ⬜ Concurrent token processing
- ⬜ Progress tracking for long-running backups
- ⬜ Cancellation support

### Reliability Enhancements
- ⬜ IPFS gateway rotation and fallbacks
- ⬜ Resumable downloads for interrupted backups
- ⬜ Content integrity verification

### Feature Additions
- ⬜ Support for additional blockchains (Solana, Flow, etc.)
- ⬜ Incremental/differential backups
- ⬜ Content deduplication
- ⬜ Metadata normalization

### User Experience
- ⬜ More detailed progress reporting
- ⬜ Summary statistics after backup completion
- ⬜ Interactive mode for configuration

## Known Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**: When backing up many NFTs, rate limiting from RPC providers or content hosts can cause failures.
   - Current mitigation: Sequential processing and retry logic
   - Future solution: Implement more sophisticated rate limiting and backoff strategies

2. **Content Availability**: Some NFT content may be unavailable due to server issues or content removal.
   - Current behavior: Logs errors and continues with other content
   - Future enhancement: Implement alternative content sources and retry strategies

3. **Special Cases**: Some NFTs use non-standard approaches that require special handling.
   - Current solution: Contract-specific extensions for known cases
   - Future enhancement: More flexible extension mechanism

4. ~~**File Extension Detection**: Files with names containing dots (e.g., "faux.parenting") were not getting proper media type detection.~~
   - ✅ Fixed: Now always detecting media type from content and applying the correct extension regardless of the original filename

## Recent Milestones

1. ✅ **Multi-Chain Support**: Added support for multiple Ethereum-based chains
2. ✅ **HTML Resource Extraction**: Implemented downloading of resources embedded in HTML-based NFTs
3. ✅ **Gallery.so Integration**: Added script to extract tokens from gallery.so collections
4. ✅ **Media Type Detection**: Improved detection of file types from binary content

## Next Milestones

1. ⬜ **Concurrent Processing**: Implement controlled concurrency for token processing
2. ⬜ **IPFS Gateway Improvements**: Add gateway rotation and fallbacks
3. ⬜ **Additional Blockchains**: Add support for more blockchain networks
4. ⬜ **Enhanced Reporting**: Improve progress and completion reporting
5. ⬜ **New Backup Directory Structure**: Group backups per artist per chain instead of just per chain
