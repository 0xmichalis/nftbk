## Documentation Changes

- Keep [README.md](mdc:README.md) up to date with latest capabilities but avoid unnecessary changes. Only update when latest capabilities introduce breakages to the documented README commands.

## Code Changes

- Ensure the code you have provided is complete (compiles and tests pass)
- Ensure the project is formatted, if there is a formatting-specific configuration in the project

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output

## Misc

- Avoid making any formatting changes when not explicitly asked to do so
- Avoid renaming variables unless explicitly asked to do so
- When writing an if/else clause, prefer putting the clause with most of the code in the else part to keep the whole conditional more readable
- Avoid arrowized code whenever possible
- When providing a solution, give me a score on a scale of 1-10 about how confident you are in the solution
