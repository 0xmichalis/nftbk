## Documentation Changes

- Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) when code changes introduce breakages to the documented README commands or logic.

## Code Changes

Every time you provide a code change, you need to ensure it follows project standards:
- code is formatted
- tests pass
The best way to ensure that is to run `make all`.

### Refactor

- Do not rename variables or refactor unnecessarily unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not make formatting changes unless specifically asked.
- When removing code, delete it entirely â€” do not just comment it out.

### Structure

- Prefer early returns to avoid long, nested if/else blocks.
- When writing or refactoring an if/else block, ensure that the longer branch is always the else block for readability.

### Code comments

- Do not add comments just to indicate new code.
- Only add comments for complex logic; otherwise, code should be self-explanatory.

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files.
- Use environment variables for secrets.
- Keep credentials out of logs and output.

## Misc

- When providing a solution, give me a score on a scale of 1-10 about how confident you are in the solution.
